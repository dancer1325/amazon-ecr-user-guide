**Important**  
Amazon ECR requires that users have permission to make calls to the `ecr:GetAuthorizationToken` API through an IAM policy before they can authenticate to a registry and push or pull any images from any Amazon ECR repository\. Amazon ECR provides several managed IAM policies to control user access at varying levels; for more information, see [Amazon Elastic Container Registry Identity\-Based Policy Examples](security_iam_id-based-policy-examples.md)\.

You can use either of these policy types to control access to your repositories, as shown in the following examples\.

This example shows an Amazon ECR repository policy, which allows for a specific IAM user to describe the repository and the images within the repository\.

```
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [{
    "Sid": "ECR Repository Policy",
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Principal": {
      "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::account-id:user/username"
    },
    "Action": [
       "ecr:DescribeImages",
       "ecr:DescribeRepositories"
    ]
  }]
}
```

This example shows an IAM policy that achieves the same goal as above, by scoping the policy to a repository \(specified by the full ARN of the repository\) using the resource parameter\. For more information about Amazon Resource Name \(ARN\) format, see [Resources](security_iam_service-with-iam.md#security_iam_service-with-iam-id-based-policies-resources)\.

    ]
    }]
}
